The code in this repository is provided only for didactical purposes. As such, it is tied to an article on my blog and cannot be updated without updating also the connected article.

For this reason, I won’t accept any pull requests, so please don’t send any. If you want to contribute, I would really appreciate if you can [link to the original article](https://matteomanferdini.com/swiftui-data-flow/) from your blog or share it on forums and social media. Thanks.
